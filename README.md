# Robosim_v1

Robosim V.1 is a robotic simulator, designed to simulate algorithms for indoor robots using artificial landmarks on the floor.
The walls of floor are represented as '#' Landmarks are represented as '.'
And the robot is represented as " ^ , v , < , > " depending on the direction it is facing in.


## Working-

The first step is to input the map-filename

The simulator calculates the dimensions of the map from file

Next step is to copy the map into memory

The simulator then asks the user to initialize the position of robot on the floor

After the initialization the simulation of the algorithm is continued.

The user can change the algorithm as per his requirement.

The Simulator in the end gives the time elapsed in execution.
